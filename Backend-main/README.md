To run the project, follow these steps:

Create an image by typing "docker build . -t image_name" in the terminal.
Once the image is created, run it on port "8000".
For Docker Desktop users, go to the "Images" tab, select the image, and click the "run" button.
Expand the "Optional Settings" menu and enter "8000" in the "Ports" field, than click "Run".
A terminal window will appear and prompt you to select the first option and the application should now be ready for use.
